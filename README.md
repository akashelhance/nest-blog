## Overview

The backend of the Blog Application is built using NestJS. It provides RESTful APIs for user authentication and post management. Authentication is implemented via Google login using PassportJS, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to secure API requests.

## Features

Authentication:

- Login using Google.

- JWT-based authentication for secured routes.

Post Management:

- Create, read, update, and delete posts.

- Public access to view post details.

Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.

- NestJS CLI installed.
